## Abstract

_**ARA Module Manager**_ is a process allowing ARA modules to require other ARA modules to be booted before booting.

## Status

This RFC is under _consideration_.

## Introduction

**ARA Module Manager** communicates over an IPC protocol. Modules that want to use ARAMM can communicate over the protocol to voice their requirements

## `require`

`require` is an event that an ARA module can push to describe the modules it requires. The message should include an array of the modules' names that are required.

## `accept`

`accept` is an event that ARAMM will push back to the requesting module if all modules desired are started. This message may contain instances as an argument in the exact order they were required in.

## `reject`

`reject` is an event that ARAMM will push back to the requesting module if any modules desired do not exist or cannot be started.

## Considerations

  - IPC seems to be completely cross-platform and cross-language so no locking into one paradigm.
  - We can likely use https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ipc for our node processes. I've worked with him before on OSS, his docs sorta suck though. :( But his apparently supports all platforms
  - If we don't want to use IPC, we can go to Mafintosh's localcast (https://github.com/mafintosh/localcast) because we really love Mafintosh.
