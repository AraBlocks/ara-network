## 0. Abstract

_*ARA Network Channels*_, or *ANC*, are peer discovery channels using popular
decentralized peer discovery mechanisms like Domain Name Systems (DNS)
[1], Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) [2], and Multicast Domain Name
Systems (mDNS) [3].

## 1. Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

Through peer discovery nodes in the *ARA Network* can interact with each
other without a central authority brokering their relationships. _*ARA
Network Channels*_ make use of popular peer discovery strategies to
enable this. While most configuration and workflow, this document
outlines the usage of various networking systems to discover peers
within a network.

## 3. Peer Discovery

_*ARA Network Channels*_ announce and discover peers over various
networks through a shared discovery key. This is often a unique shared
secret between two or more interested parties whom wish to peer
connections.

## 4. Domain Name System (DNS)

Through traditional *DNS over UDP*, peers can be discovered using a
shared secret, or more conventionally known as a *discovery key*. The *discovery
key* can be used in place of hostnames for an `A` record's **name** field. This
allows peers to respond with an "answer" to a query's "question" for some `A`
record when comparing **name** fields when queries occur. This creates a
*one-to-many* relationship mapping many peers to a single shared discovery key
while using core DNS. Discovery keys used in conjunction with DNS offer a
channel of discovery for peers over the Internet without changing the DNS
protocol.

## 5. Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS)

Multicast DNS helps enable peer discovery over a local network without the
need for a local DNS (4) server. Peers announce themselves on a domain and
can discover others announcing on the same domain. *mDNS* operates like
traditional DNS over local networks allowing resolution of DNS records.
*mDNS* and *DNS* working together enable broader peer discovery by
combining both local and external networks.

### 5.1 Domain

_*ARA Network Channels*_ broadcast on `ara.local` and `<DKEY>.ara.local`
by default. where `<DKEY>` is the discovery key for a network node.
Networks nodes are configured to loopback making themselves discoverable
on the same machine's network interfaces.

*Example mDNS domain with discovery key subdomain:*

```
6c67e61f60cc8692acbccf27ede4547afe8d9fa282ff5269c89a865e4bc3bb92.ara.local
```
