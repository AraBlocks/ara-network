## 0. Abstract

_*ARA Network Secrets*_, or *ANS* describes an on-disk format of
network keys for ARA network nodes [1] enabling peer discovery and
authentication based on asymmetric cryptography. _*ARA Network Nodes*_
generate network secrets and make their public keys available to
interested entities.

## 1.Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.

## 2. Introduction

_*ARA Network Secrets*_ enable secure discovery and a secure relationship
with entities interested in interacting with network nodes. Network
nodes emerging into existence issue and offer their public keys to
interested entities in the network.

## 3. Shared Secret

Network secrets are created from a shared secret key. This secret key is
shared between the network node who created it and the peers in the
network who want to communicate with it.

### 3.1 Encryption Key

Shared secret keys are used to derive an encryption key when
encrypting or decrypting public and secret keystores found in *ARA
Network Secrets Files*.

An encryption key can be computed by taking a 16 byte BLAKE2b hash of
the shared secret key, or more formally:

```js
key = blake2b(secret, 16)
```

## 4. Discovery Key

Discovery keys are 32 byte BLAKE2b hashes of a 32 byte result from a
pseudo random number generator

## 5. Key Pairs

### 5.1 Private

### 5.2 Public

## Encryption

### AES

#### Cipher

#### Digest

## JSON Keystore

## Binary Format

### Private

### Public

## Secrets Handshake
