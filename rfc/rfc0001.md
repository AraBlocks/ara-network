## Abstract

_**ARA Network Secrets**_, or simply *ANS* is a collection of standard
encryption, decryption, and storage formats for the creation and
transmission of *Network Secrets* within the *ARA Network*. *ANS*
describes a set of standard *AES* schemes used within networking
protocols and encryption/decryption scenarios. *ANS* also describes an
on disk *JSON Keystore* suitable for transmission within the network.

## Status

This RFC is under _active development and consideration_.
